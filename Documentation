  This documents shows and describes the four benchmarks we have chosen for our project.

- Redis

- MySQL

- Network latency—netperf
  Netperf will be used to measure round-trip network latency.  The CloudLab x86_64 and ARM architecture's will run the server while another machine acts as the client. 
  Our client will send out a 100-byte request to the server which the server will send a 200-byte response back to. The time it takes for the client to get this response 
  after sending out the request will give us the network latency.

- HPC—Linpack
  Linpack solves a dense system of linear equations using an algorithm that carries out LU factorization with partial pivoting. The majority of compute operations will 
  be spent in double-precision floating point multiplication. This benchmark is typically based on a linear algebra library that will be heavily optimized for the machine 
  architecture we will be building. We will utilize Intel Math Kernel Library for our Linpack binary.
