# CSC 468 Project - Team 5

## Team Members:
- Christian Johnson
- Zach Force
- Fergus Horner 
- Chris Popeck 

## Chosen Benchmarks:
- Redis
- MySQL
- Network latency—netperf
  Netperf will be used to measure round-trip network latency.  When using the CloudLab x86 and ARM architexture it will run the server while our machine runs the client.  Our client will send out a request to the server which the server will send a response back to, and from the time the clients request gets sent to the time it takes to recieve the servers response will give us the latency.
- HPC—Linpack
