# CSC 468 Project - Team 5

## Team Members:
- Christian Johnson
- Zach Force
- Fergus Horner 
- Chris Popeck 

## Chosen Benchmarks:
- Redis
- MySQL
- Network latency—netperf
  Netperf will be used to measure round-trip network latency.  The CloudLab x86_64 and ARM architexture's will run the server while our machine runs the client.  Our client will send out a 100-byte request to the server which the server will send a 200-byte response back to. The time it takes for the client to get this response after sending out the request will give us the network latency.
- HPC—Linpack
